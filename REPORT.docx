OUTLINE:
GoldFit is a dynamic health and fitness tracking application designed to help users log their daily physical activities and visualise their progress over time. The application also allows users to register and securely log in and record various workout details such as activity type, duration and calories burned. A key feature of GoldFit is its dashboard, which provides an instant visual summary of the user’s recent performance using interactive charts. This app aims to motivate its users by providing a clear history of their fitness career in a secure and easy to use interface. 

ARCHITECTURE 
The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:
	Data Tier (model): MySQL database hosting relational data for (users and workouts)
	Application tier (controller): Node.js and Express server handling routing, session management, middleware validation, and database queries
	Presentation tier (view): EJS templates that are rendered on the server, utlising bootstrap 5 for responsive design and chart.js for client side data visualisation

DATA MODEL
The database (health) consists of two relational tables:
	Users: This stores account credentials, advanced security is implemented using hashed passwords (bcrypt) rather than just plain text
	Workouts: Stores the exercise logs. This also has a foreign key (user_id) linking each workout to specific user, creating a one-to-many relationship (one user has many workouts)
USER FUNCTIONALITY
	Registration/Login: Users can securely log in, the system will support required gold user but validates real sessions 
	Dashboard: Upon login, users will be able to see a line graph visualising their workout duration over time (advanced UI)
	Add workout: a form that allows users to input activity type, duration and date
	Search: Users can search their workout history by using keywords (such as: running or specific notes)
	Logout: Securely destroys the current session 

ADVANCED TECHNIQUES
For this I have implemented several advanced techniques beyond the current scope 
Data Visualisation (chart.js): Instead of just listing data tables, I integrated Chart.js in dashboard.ejs . In doing so, it requires passing backend data (EJS variables) into the frontend JavaScript context to render a dynamic line graph. 
	Code ref: views/dashboard.ejs (script section)

Secure Authentication (Bcrypt and sessions): I used bcrypt to has passwords before storage (simulated with logic) and express-session for stateful authentication, ensuring pages like the /dashboard are protected from non-logged-in users 
	Code ref: index.js (login route and middleware)

Modern UI Framework: The application utilises Bootstrap 5 via CDN for a fully responsive professional grid layout
